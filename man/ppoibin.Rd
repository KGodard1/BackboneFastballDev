\title{The Poisson Binomial Distribution}
\usage{
ppoibin(kk, pp, method = "RNA", wts = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{kk}{The values where the cdf or pmf to be evaluated.}

\item{pp}{The vector for `p_j`'s which are the success probabilities for indicators.}

\item{method}{"DFT-CF" for the DFT-CF method, "RF" for the recursive formula, "RNA" for the refined normal approximation, "NA" for the normal approximation, and "PA" for the Poisson approximation.}

\item{wts}{The weights for `p_j`'s.}
}
\value{
the entire cdf, pmf, quantiles, and random numbers
}
\description{
`ppoibin` is a function from the now archived package poibin.
    It computes the cdf, pmf, quantile function, and random number generation for the
    Poisson Binomial Distribution.
}
\details{
The `poibin` package was created by Yili Hong (2013). Since the package has been archived, the ppoibin function source code is used in the sdsm function, via GPL-2 license agreement. The reference to Hong's paper is below.

The function is used in the \link[backbone]{sdsm} function.
