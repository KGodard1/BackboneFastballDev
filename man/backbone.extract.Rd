\title{Extracts the backbone of a weighted network using results from a null model}
\usage{
backbone.extract(backbone, signed = TRUE, alpha = 0.05, fwer = "none")
}
\arguments{
\item{backbone}{backbone: backbone S3 class object, as returned by \link{sdsm}, \link{fdsm}, or \link{hyperg}.}

\item{signed}{Boolean: TRUE if signed backbone is to be returned, FALSE if binary backbone is to be returned}

\item{alpha}{Real: Precision of significance test}

\item{fwer}{string: type of familywise error rate correction to be applied; c("none","bonferroni",holm"). If "holm", Holm Bonferroni Family-wise Error Rate test is used,
if "bonferroni", Bonferroni Family-wise Error Rate test should be used.
By default, this parameter is set to "NULL" and the given 'alpha' value is used for all tests with no correction for family-wise error rates.}
}
\value{
backbone graph: Binary or signed backbone graph, of same class as inputted in one of \link{sdsm}, \link{fdsm}, or \link{hyperg}.
}
\description{
`backbone.extract` returns a binary or signed adjacency matrix
     containing the backbone that retains only the significant edges.
}
\details{
The "backbone" S3 class object is composed of two matrices, a summary dataframe and (optionally, if generated by using \link{fdsm}) a 'dyad_values' vector.

The Holm Bonferroni correction is originally a port from python code written by Dr. Samin Aref.
    The python function can be viewed here: \href{ https://github.com/saref}{ https://github.com/saref}.
    The authors thank Dr. Aref greatly for his contribution to this package!
