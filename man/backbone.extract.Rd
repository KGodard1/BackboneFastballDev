\title{Extracts the backbone of a weighted network using results from a null model}
\usage{
backbone.extract(matrix, signed = TRUE, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{backbone: backbone class which is a list containing two matrices, positive and negative, and a summary list as returned by \link{sdsm}, \link{fdsm}, or \link{hyperg}.}

\item{signed}{Boolean: TRUE if signed backbone is to be returned, FALSE if binary backbone is to be returned}

\item{alpha}{Real: Precision of significance test (one-tailed if only the positive matrix supplied, two-tailed if positive and negative matrices supplied)}
}
\value{
backbone graph: Binary or signed backbone graph, of same class as inputted in one of \link{sdsm}, \link{fdsm}, or \link{hyperg}.
}
\description{
`backbone.extract` returns a binary or signed adjacency matrix
     containing the backbone that retains only the significant edges.
}
\examples{
probs <- sdsm(davis)
bb <- backbone.extract(probs, alpha = .1)
