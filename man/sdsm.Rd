\title{The stochastic degree sequence model (sdsm) for backbone probabilities}
\usage{
sdsm(B, model = "bicm")
}

\item{B}{graph: Bipartite graph object of class matrix, sparse matrix, igraph, edgelist, or network object.}

\item{model}{string: sdsm is using the bicm model to compute the probabilities. If an older model is in}

\value{
backbone, a list(positive, negative, summary). Here
    `positive` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or above the observed value in the projection,
    `negative` is a matrix of probabilities of edge weights being equal to or below the observed value in the projection, and
    `summary` is a data frame summary of the inputted matrix and the model used including: model name, number of rows, skew of row sums, number of columns, skew of column sums, and running time.
}
\description{
`sdsm` computes the probability of edge weights being
    above or below the observed edge weights in a bipartite projection
    using the stochastic degree sequence model.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return
    the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
}
\details{
Specifically, the sdsm function compares an edge's observed weight in the projection \code{B*t(B)}
   to the distribution of weights expected in a projection obtained from a random bipartite network where
   both the row vertex degrees and column vertex degrees are approximately fixed.

sdsm uses the Bipartite Configuration Model \link{bicm} to compute probabilities for the Poisson binomial distribution.

The "backbone" S3 class object returned is composed of two matrices, a summary dataframe and (optionally, if generated by using \link{fdsm}) a 'dyad_values' vector.
