\title{The stochastic degree sequence model (sdsm)}
\usage{
sdsm(B, trials = 1000, model = "polytope", progress = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{graph: Bipartite graph object of class matrix, sparse matrix, igraph, edgelist, or network object.}

\item{trials}{Integer: Number of random bipartite graphs generated. Default is 0.}

\item{model}{String: A method used to compute probabilities for generating random bipartite graphs. Can be c("logit", "probit", "cauchit", "log", "cloglog", "lpm", "chi2", "curveball", "polytope").}

\item{progress}{Boolean: If \link[utils]{txtProgressBar} should be used to measure progress}
}
\value{
backbone, a list(positive, negative, dyad_values, summary).
positive: matrix of proportion of times each entry of the projected matrix B is above the corresponding entry in the generated projection.
negative: matrix of proportion of times each entry of the projected matrix B is below the corresponding entry in the generated projection.
dyad_values: list of edge weight for i,j in each generated projection, included if 'dyad' not NULL and 'trials > 0'.
summary: a data frame summary of the inputted matrix and the model used including: model name, number of rows, skew of row sums, number of columns, skew of column sums, and running time.
}
\description{
`sdsm` computes the proportion of generated edges
    above or below the observed value using the stochastic degree sequence model.
    Once computed, use \code{\link{backbone.extract}} to return
    the backbone matrix for a given alpha value.
}
\details{
If the 'model' parameter is one of c('logit', 'probit', 'cauchit', 'log', 'cloglog'), then this model is used as a 'link' function, as described by \link[stats]{glm} and \link[stats]{family}.

If 'trials'>0, and 'model' == 'curveball', probabilities are computed by using \link[backbone]{curveball} function `trials` times. The proportion of each cell being 1 is used as its probability.
