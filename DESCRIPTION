Description: Provides methods for extracting from a weighted graph 
    a binary or signed backbone that retains only the significant edges. 
    The user may input a weighted graph, or a bipartite graph 
    from which a weighted graph is first constructed via projection.
    Backbone extraction methods include the stochastic degree sequence model (Neal, Z. P. (2014). <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2014.06.001>),
    hypergeometric model (Neal, Z. (2013). <doi:10.1007/s13278-013-0107-y>), 
    the fixed degree sequence model (Zweig, K. A., and Kaufmann, M. (2011). <doi:10.1007/s13278-011-0021-0>),
    as well as a universal threshold method.
